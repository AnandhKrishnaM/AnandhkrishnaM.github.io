I am Anandh, a theoretical physics student at IISER Pune. This is my personal webpage where I will be sharing my thoughts on various topics. I am interested in General theory of relativity, quantum field theory, quantum gravity, foundations of physics and whatever I feel as the good direction for pursuit of truth about nature. This webpage is a result of such pursuit and fun.
